  Reinforcing loop and balancing loop are the two foundational structures of systems thinking. Reinforcing loop will influence more of the 
same action and cause it growth or decline. Reinforcing loop like the situation you get income and save it in your bank account, the 
interest rate will cause your money increase and it will grow more and more money. Balancing loop is to move the current state to the 
state that you want, you can accomplish that through some actions. Basically, you need to take some actions to achieve your goal in a game. 
It like the you have increase and decrease in a loop.
When we playing power grid, these two situations occur in the game. When we buy the city in this game, we need to burn enough fuel to 
generate the factory, we need to generate the factory in order to make money from it, the more city we buy the more money we can earn. 
The card we draw decide how much fuel we should burn. Each card has different function and you need to pay for a better card. This is a 
reinforcing loop because the card we draw causes how much fuel we should burn, the better card we have the more factory we can generate.
Which influences the money we can make, when we have a better card, we can cause less when burning the fuel. That means we can have more
money left and the output will be increase every turn since we can make more money. This series of action is the reinforcing loop. 
  The balancing loop in this game is pretty simple, the goal we want to achieve is to win this game. In order to do that we need to have 17
cities and generate all of the factories at the same time. We need to have the strategy to win. When we have 17 cities, the current state
is we have enough cities but not enough money to generate all the factory, so our desire state is to generate all of them, our action is 
to calculate the money we need to generate all of the factory and burn enough fuel in this turn to make such money. If we want to generate
all of them, we need to lower our cost in the last turn. We need to decrease our output in the last turn so we can generate all factory in 
this turn. In the next turn we can generate and achieve our goal. When we choose the first city in the game, we should look at how much money 
we will cost when buying the near by city. Since the money is
different in each city, we need to have a great start so that we can win. When we buying city, this is also the reinforcing loop in the 
game, the place we choose determine the next location we need to buy. When the price is too high, we donâ€™t have enough money to buy it, 
the action, buying the city which nearby city has a high price, will cause not enough money to buy next city and the money you can make
will be decline. If you buy the city which nearby area is cheap that mean you can save the extra money in order to buy the next city. 
This action can lead to the increase of the income. In this part of game mechanism will reinforce themselves.The game mechanism that balance 
themselves is the card. The card we draw can determine the fuel we burn; we need to draw the 
corresponding card to generate factory, when we have too many fuels or not enough fuel to generate the factory it will cause unbalanced. 
If our goal is to generate all the factory we have, we need to stores the fuel so we can use it in the next turn. The card decides how 
many fuels we should burn so we need to get the corresponding card. The current state is not enough to burn, the action is getting the
card that we need and stores, our goal is to generate all the factory. This series of action balance the game itself.
